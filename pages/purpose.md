## **Purpose**

This Circular establishes the general policy for the planning, budgeting, governing, procuring, and managing, and evaluating personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology resources that support the quality, integrity, design, collection, processing, editing, compilation, storage, transmission, analysis, release, dissemination, accessibility, maintenance, security, cataloguing, sharing, and disposition of Federal information and supporting infrastructure and services. This Circular also addresses responsibilities for managing personally identifiable information, requirements for implementing the Government Paperwork Elimination Act and related electronic documentation statutes, and policy on protecting Federal information resources as appendices. Although this Circular touches on many specific issues such as privacy, confidentiality, information quality, dissemination, and statistical policy, those topics are covered more fully in other Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies, which are available on the [OMB website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/).
